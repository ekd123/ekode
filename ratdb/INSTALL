you need autoconf, automake, intltool & libtool to build.

First you need to run ./autogen.sh.
This script helps you create the configure script, or you can't do anything.
(even though you can build it manually)

You can use autogen.sh just like configure.

It will help you create Makefiles. When you've done with configure,
you can use make now.

Good luck.

A VERY SIMPLE INSTALLATION
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --sysconfdir=/etc
$ make -j5
$ sudo make install
