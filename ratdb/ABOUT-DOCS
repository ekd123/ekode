The API reference manual is auto-generated by gtk-doc.

Information about gtk-doc: http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-doc-manual/stable/

Follow the instructions if you want to generate it yourself.
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-gtk-doc=yes --enable-gtk-doc-html=yes
    $ cd docs
    $ make clean
    $ make

If you want to install it to Devhelp (a tool that helps you read documentation), you can also
    $ sudo make install

Then you can read documentation with Devhelp.
