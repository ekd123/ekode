ck: the children killer
=======================
this library saves your life from too many children processes.
it's default not to kill children if the parent died.
Irix and Linux has some features to help you but not portable.

ck is more portable. it's able to run under all the POSIX platforms.

What does ck do?
================
* ck manages all children created by ck_fork.
* if parent quits, then kill them!
* if a child quits, then the parent removes the item from the children list.
* if parent has received a signal that can make the process quit, then kill
  all the children.

What will happen if a process is created by ck_fork?
====================================================
* create a thread to poll if the ppid is changed.
  this can find out if the parent was killed by SIGKILL.
* do whatever you want!

for example?
============
See test.c in src.

To compile it:
   $ cd src
   $ cc *.c darr/*.c

Run ./a.out to see what test suite is here.

Result
======
Yeah, the child died after the parent died.
And we didn't see "still here".
