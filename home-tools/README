HOME-Tools helps you compile HShell.

USAGE
=====
./home-tools.sh [--with-install]

After input the working directory, all the steps will be done automatically.

If you want to install rather than just build them, you should run 
"home-tools.sh --with-install".

Note that HOME-tools only accpet this argument and other arguments will be
ignored.

Because HShell needs eggtraymanager to run, you may always want to run it 
with --with-install.
